"""
needs.py - the Needs page: one-select triggers that DO something, not just words.

Each need has a level:
    emergency  full-screen red alert on the board + alarm + the sentence spoken
               (repeated) + a red banner on the controller + caregiver phone push
    urgent     chime + sentence spoken twice + caregiver phone push
    normal     sentence spoken once

Caregiver phone push (optional): set NTFY_TOPIC=some-long-random-name in server/.env,
install the free "ntfy" app on the caregiver's phone and subscribe to the same topic.
AdaptiBoard does NOT dial 911 itself - it says it out loud and alerts people nearby.

Edit this list freely: label | emoji | level | sentence | pictogram word (None = emoji).
The first row (4 tiles) is reachable fastest, so emergencies go first.
